# Pentago
This is the online version of Pentago XL. A abstract strategy game from Swedan. This is the extended version where you can play with two, three or four players. The board has 81 empty spaces that are divided into 9 blocks that hold 9 spaces. The 9 blocks are set-up 3 x 3. Each of the blocks rotate left or right on the current player's turn. A current player's turn consists of choosing a space to mark and then rotating a block. The rotation of the blocks is where strategy comes into play. Check out the *Game flow* below to learn more!

## How to access the game
Click the :paperclip: link under the **About** section 

### Game flow
1. The landing page allows you to choose how many players will be joining you in this round of Pentago. You can choose **2 Players**, **3 Players**, or **4 Players**. Once you select how many players, the initial game board with 81 one empty spaces will be displayed. It will also showcase who's turn it is below. Player 1 starts the game.
2. Player 1 will mark one of the 81 empty spaces on the board. As soon as it is marked, Player 1's marker will show. 
3. Player 1 will then be prompted to select a block they would like to rotate. *The top left block is always highlighted at the beginning*, but the Player can choose any block they wish. *You can click anywhere on the board without being concerned with marking another space on the board.*
4. Once you've selected your block, you can press the Left or Right Arrow buttons to rotate that block. Then it will be the next **Player's turn!**

   As the board fills up it becomes harder as you will now have to play strategic offence and defence, since a rotation can determine a winner. 

5. Once there Player reaches 5 in a row *vertically, horizontally, or diagonally* the Winner will be displayed. The Pentagon button at the bottom will allow you to flip to the next screen where the winner is displayed again and you have the option of going another round!

   **Draw/Tie**
   If the board fills up with no winner then it will be declared a *Tie Game*.The Pentagon button at the bottom will allow you to flip to the next screen and you have the option of going another round!
